There's a few things you can change here. 
- Username: Change your bot's username on Discord
- Icon: Change the bot's avatar
- Public bot: Toggles the ability for other users to add your bot to their server.
- Require Oauth2 Code Grant: Don't check this. Just, don't.

#### Getting the token
Go back to the **Bot** page and copy the token. Save it somewhere, you will need that later.
